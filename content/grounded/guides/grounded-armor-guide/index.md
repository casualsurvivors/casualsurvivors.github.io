In Grounded there are three types of armor Light, Medium, and Heavy. Each armor type has their pros and cons. The heavier the armor the more stamina you use and the slower you can attack but you get more defense so choosing the right type of armor for your play style is something this guide will help achieve.

All armors will need to be crafted at a Workbench and can be repaired by hand.
