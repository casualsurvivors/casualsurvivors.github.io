Where to find the Glider and the requirements to obtain it in the Sons of the Forest.
{{< /lead >}}

## Glider in Sons of the Forest
The Glider is a tool that lets you glide through the sky and scout out areas from far above. Just be careful not to fall to your death!

The Glider has no durability, doesn't require additional items, and can't be crafted into something else, so this is the final form.

## Requirements to Obtain
**None** - Some items require the player to solve a puzzle or use other collected items to obtain. For example, you may need to dig into the ground to find an item, so in situations like that, you will need a shovel. 

## Glider Map
Below is a world map with all the known locations for the Glider.

## More Possible Locations
Currently, there are 5 known locations for the Glider. More locations may come in future updates, but at this time players can only obtain it at the location above.
We will make sure to update our map with any new spots when Sons of the Forest gets any new updates for the Glider or if the community finds more spawn locations.

## Obtain Once
The Glider can only be obtained once. After obtaining one the others will despawn preventing you from looting it from other locations. This is how Sons of the Forest enables the players to have multiple loot options with major items. 

## Conclusion
There are no requirements for the Glider and there are many known locations to obtain it. So, if you want to collect all the items in Sons of the Forest, make sure you head to one of the markers on the map above and collect your Glider!
