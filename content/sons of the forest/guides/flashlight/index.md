Where to find the Flashlight and the requirements to obtain it in the Sons of the Forest.
{{< /lead >}}

## Flashlight in Sons of the Forest
The Flashlight is a left-handed item that provides the user with light. The item doesn't have any durability, so there is no concern about it breaking. However, it does require batteries to make use of it.

To check the battery levels of the Flashlight, hover the mouse over it while in the inventory. The light blue bar under the item's icon is your indicator of how much power you have left (See the image below).

## Requirements to Obtain
**Easy Puzzle** - Some items require the player to solve a puzzle or use other collected items to obtain. For example, you may need to dig into the ground to find an item, so in situations like that, you will need a shovel. 

## Flashlight Map
Below is a world map with all the known locations for the Flashlight.

## Flashlight Location 1
Head to the location 1 icon on the map for the Flashlight. There will additionally be a GPS Marker at the same location, so if you see a pink '!' on the map please follow that.

The Flashlight is part of the dead man's hanging body. You need to solve the puzzle to access it.

### (Puzzle) Cutting the Rope
There isn't anything special about cutting the rope. You just need to find a way up top and swing one of your sharp weapons at the rope.
Upon swinging your weapon, the rope will break causing the dead body to drop. You will want to circle back down as the fall damage will kill you.

## More Possible Locations
Currently, there is only 1 known location for the Flashlight. More locations may come in future updates, but at this time players can only obtain it at the location above.
We will make sure to update our map with any new spots when Sons of the Forest gets any new updates for the Flashlight.

## Obtain Once
The Flashlight can only be obtained once. If the item had other spawn locations (Which may happen in the future), they would despawn preventing you from picking up multiple versions of the item. This is how Sons of the Forest enables the players to have multiple options when looting major items. 

## Conclusion
There are no requirements for the Flashlight and there is only 1 known location to obtain it. So, if you want to collect all the items in Sons of the Forest, make sure you head to the marked spot and collect your Flashlight!
