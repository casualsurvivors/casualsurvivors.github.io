Sons of the Forest Knight V location, requirements, and everything you need to know about them and more!
{{< /lead >}}

## Sons of the Forest Knight V
The Knight V is an electric unicycle that is very similar to a hoverboard. It is a terrestrial vehicle that can be used for faster traveling in Sons of the Forest. The device requires batteries to power, however when first finding one it comes fully charged. 

When dismounted from Knight V, it will appear on your map so you can locate it again in the future. 

### Using the Knight V
The Knight V counts as a vehicle, so you can mount and dismount it. Double jump to dismount and interact with E when close to mount it. Movement is a bit 'loose' and slow to respond when using it. Additionally, when traversing over rough terrain you may fly off and injure yourself.

It's great for long distances and over semi-flat terrain. Make sure to bring an extra pair of batteries with you just in case you run low on power. 

## Requirements to Obtain
**None** - You can walk up and start using any of the Knight V without the need for any other items.
