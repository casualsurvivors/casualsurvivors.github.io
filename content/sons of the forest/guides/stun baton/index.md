{{< /lead >}}

## Requirements to Obtain
Some items have multiple locations or requirements to obtain them. Make sure to keep this in mind when looking over the map below.
For the Stun Baton, no additional items are required. You just need to interact with it when you find it. 

## Map Location

## Stun Baton Location 1
The green marker on the map above is location 1. Head to that spot on the map and look for a small waterfall as seen below.
The stun baton will be in a pile of skulls. Don't mind the many skulls that the stun baton is in, you will be fine...
