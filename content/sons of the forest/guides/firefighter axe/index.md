Where to find the Firefighter Axe and the requirements to obtain it in the Sons of the Forest.
{{< /lead >}}

## Firefighter Axe in Sons of the Forest
The Firefighter Axe is a strong, but slow-swinging melee weapon.

The Firefighter Axe has no durability, doesn't require additional items, and can't be crafted into something else, so this is the final form.

## Requirements to Obtain
**Gun Rope, Rebreather, & Shovel** - Some items require the player to solve a puzzle or use other collected items to obtain. For example, you may need to dig into the ground to find an item, so in situations like that, you will need a  Shovel. 

The Firefighter Axe requires the [Gun Rope](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/rope-gun/), [Rebreather](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/rebreather/), and [Shovel](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/shovel/) to access the bunker with it.

To be exact, you only need the **Shovel to access the Bunker** and gain access to all the contents within. However, to access the Shovel you need the Gun Rope and the Rebreather, which is why you need all 3 of these items to access the Firefighter Axe. Meaning, if a new method of obtaining the Shovel without the Gun Rope & Rebreather would lower the item requirements for the Firefighter Axe.

### Tips for Finding the Firefighter Axe
Head towards the location on the map and look for a golf kart and 2 construction levelers on yellow stands (see below). As you get closer, a **pulsing green circle** will appear near the area to let you know there is something there. Once you find the location, walk in the middle of all 3 objects and you should see a shovel icon letting you know that you need to dig here. Well, do just that! Dig using your [Shovel](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/shovel/) to access the Bunker.

## Obtain Once
The Firefighter Axe can only be obtained once. If the item had other spawn locations (Which may happen in the future), they would despawn preventing you from picking up multiple versions of the item. This is how Sons of the Forest enables the players to have multiple options when looting major items.
