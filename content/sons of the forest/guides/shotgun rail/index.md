{{< /lead >}}

## Requirements to Obtain
Some items have multiple locations or requirements to obtain them. Make sure to keep this in mind when looking over the map below.
For the Shotgun Rail, no additional items are required. You just need to interact with it when you find it. 

## Map Location

## Shotgun Rail Location 1
The green marker on the map above is location 1. Head to that spot on the map and look for the dead person up against a tent.
Don't mind the dead body. Grab the Shotgun Rail and it will be added to the orange case in your inventory!
