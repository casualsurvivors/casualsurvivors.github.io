Where to find the Track Suit and the requirements to obtain it in the Sons of the Forest.
{{< /lead >}}

## Track Suit in Sons of the Forest
The Track Suit is a cosmetic item for Virginia. Walk up to her after she's friendly and interact with her to equip her with the outfit. 

The Track Suit has no durability, doesn't require additional items, and can't be crafted into something else, so this is the final form.

## Requirements to Obtain
**Maintenance Keycard, Gun Rope, Rebreather, & Shovel** - Some items require the player to solve a puzzle or use other collected items to obtain. For example, you may need to dig into the ground to find an item, so in situations like that, you will need a Shovel. 

The [Gun Rope](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/rope-gun/) and [Rebreather](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/rebreather/) are requirements for the [Shovel](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/shovel/), which is what you need to access the Bunker of Maintenance Shaft A where you can obtain the [Maintenance Keycard](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/maintenance-keycard/). The Maintenance Keycard is the only item you need to access the area within the cave where the Track Suit is located.

## Obtain Once
The Track Suit can only be obtained once. If the item had other spawn locations (Which may happen in the future), they would despawn preventing you from picking up multiple versions of the item. This is how Sons of the Forest enables the players to have multiple options when looting major items.
