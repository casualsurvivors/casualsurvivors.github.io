Where to find the Flashlight Attachment and the requirements to obtain it in the Sons of the Forest.
{{< /lead >}}

## Flashlight Attachment in Sons of the Forest
The Flashlight Attachment is an item you can attach to certain weapons such as the [Pistol](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/pistol/) or [Shotgun](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/shotgun/). 

**More information to come soon.**

## Requirements to Obtain
**Cave, Gun Rope, & Rebreather** - Some items require the player to solve a puzzle or use other collected items to obtain. For example, you may need to dig into the ground to find an item, so in situations like that, you will need a Flashlight Attachment. 

The Flashlight Attachment requires [Gun Rope](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/rope-gun/) and the [Rebreather](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/rebreather/) to progress into the cave. Without these items, it will just lead to a dead end preventing further exploration of the cave. 

## Flashlight Attachment Map
Below is a world map with all the known locations for the Flashlight Attachment.

## Flashlight Attachment Location #1
The green marker labeled 1 on the map is the location of the cave where you can find the Flashlight Attachment. The Flashlight Attachment is a room with the dead bodies of military persons. They are in subtle camo gear and are very different than the normal orange maintenance crew that you've seen thus far.

### Tips for Finding the Flashlight Attachment
Head towards the location on the map and keep your eyes peeled for the cave icon to show up. Once it appears, head towards it to find the bodies just outside the cave. Head on inside.

Once inside, you will need to use the Rope Gun to cross the gap.

Then use your Rebreather to go underwater to the next section. If you need some oxygen, there is some underneath the zipline at the start of the cave. You can head back to pick it up and then use the Zip Line to cross back into the area.

Head further into the cave until you reach a large room with dead military people. One of the dead will be holding onto the light as though they were using it as a light source.

## More Items Nearby
[Shovel](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/shovel/) can be found further in this cave. Make sure to check out those guides for more information!

## More Possible Locations
Currently, there is only 1 known location for the Flashlight Attachment. More locations may come in future updates, but at this time players can only obtain it at the location above.
We will make sure to update our map with any new spots when Sons of the Forest gets any new updates for the Stun Baton.

## Obtain Once
The Flashlight Attachment can only be obtained once. If the item had other spawn locations (Which may happen in the future), they would despawn preventing you from picking up multiple versions of the item. This is how Sons of the Forest enables the players to have multiple options when looting major items. 

## Conclusion
There are no requirements for the Flashlight Attachment and there is only 1 known location to obtain it. So, if you want to collect all the items in Sons of the Forest, make sure you head to the marked spot and collect your used Flashlight Attachment!
