Where to find the Pistol and the requirements to obtain it.
{{< /lead >}}

## Requirements to Obtain
Some items have multiple locations or requirements to obtain them. Make sure to keep this in mind when looking over the map below.
For the Pistol, no additional items are required. You just need to swim to the boat, climb aboard, and interact with it when you find it. 

## Map Location

## Pistol Location 1
The green marker on the map above is location 1. Head to that spot on the map and swim out to the boat in the water. 
Climb upon the boat (You will need to interact 'E' to do this.) and then pick up your new shiny pew pewer!

### WARNING
There is a shark in the waters, so it's strongly suggested that you save before attempting to obtain the Pistol at this location.
I had no problems getting onto the boat, it was leaving the boat that the shark became the problem for me. 

## More Locations
There may be more locations for the Machete. If there are we will make sure to update the map with a more up-to-date version with the location(s).

Do you know of a spot that we've missed? Reach out to us on Discord with a screenshot of the location and we will update the guide with it!
