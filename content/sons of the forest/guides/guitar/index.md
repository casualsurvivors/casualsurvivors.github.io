{{< /lead >}}

## Guitar in Sons of the Forest
The Guitar is a 1-handed melee weapon with the following stats;

The Guitar has no durability, doesn't require additional items, and can't be crafted into something else, so this is the final form.

## Requirements to Obtain
**Maintenance Keycard, Gun Rope, Rebreather, & Shovel** - Some items require the player to solve a puzzle or use other collected items to obtain. For example, you may need to dig into the ground to find an item, so in situations like that, you will need a Shovel. 

The [Gun Rope](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/rope-gun/) and [Rebreather](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/rebreather/) are requirements for the [Shovel](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/shovel/), which is what you need to access the Bunker of Maintenance Shaft A where you can obtain the [Maintenance Keycard](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/maintenance-keycard/). The Maintenance Keycard is the only item you need to access the area within the cave where the Guitar is located.

## Guitar Map
Below is a world map with all the known locations for the Guitar.

## Guitar Location 1
Head to the green location 1 marked on the map and look for a pulsing green icon on your map in the game. The location is marked in the game with the pulsing green circle, so head toward that when you see it in the area.

Once in the area, you are searching the cave entrance or the abandoned golf cart.

Inside the cave, head further until you need to use your keycard.

Progress past the Gym and up to a second floor. On the second floor keep progressing until you reach the club area. On the bar counter directly in front of you when entering the club is where you find the Guitar. If it is not there, then save and reload your game as sometimes this item doesn't always spawn.

## More Possible Locations
Currently, there is only 1 known location for the Guitar. More locations may come in future updates, but at this time players can only obtain it at the location above.
We will make sure to update our map with any new spots when Sons of the Forest gets any new updates for the Guitar.

## Obtain Once
The Guitar can only be obtained once. If the item had other spawn locations (Which may happen in the future), they would despawn preventing you from picking up multiple versions of the item. This is how Sons of the Forest enables the players to have multiple options when looting major items. 

## Conclusion
There are no requirements for the Guitar and there is only 1 known location to obtain it. So, if you want to collect all the items in Sons of the Forest, make sure you head to the marked spot and collect your Guitar!
