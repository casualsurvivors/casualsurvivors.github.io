Where to find the Leather Jacket and the requirements to obtain it in the Sons of the Forest.
{{< /lead >}}

## Leather Jacket in Sons of the Forest
The Leather Jacket is cloth gear that will protect you against the weather a bit better than your default clothing will. 

The Leather Jacket has no durability, doesn't require additional items, and can't be crafted into something else, so this is the final form.

## Requirements for the Leather Jacket
**Cave & Combat** - Some items require the player to solve a puzzle or use other collected items to obtain. For example, you may need to dig into the ground to find an item, so in situations like that, you will need a shovel. 

The Leather Jacket requires you to explore a cave with cannibals to obtain it, so expect combat. 

## Leather Jacket Map
Below is a world map with all the known locations for the Leather Jacket.

## The Leather Jacket Location #1
The green marker labeled 1 on the map is the location of the cave you need to enter to obtain the Leather Jacket. Once inside, if you hug the right wall you will eventually reach your destination. If you see a dim red light, you are in the correct area. Just look for the dead maintenance body hanging from the roof.

### Tips for Finding Leather Jacket
The cave is on the shoreline, so head toward the ocean and follow the water until you find the cave shown below. Additionally, the cave shows up on your map when you are close enough, so you can head toward that when you can see it.

Once inside the cave, 4 cave lights will help brighten up your path. The 4th light is where the cave forks left or right. It's at that point you want to make sure you take the right path (which the light is shining towards, see image below) and you will eventually reach the Leather Jacket.

If you've entered a room with a cliff and 2 additional cave lights, you have taken a left at the fork and will need to head back. That's the room for the [Rebreather](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/rebreather/), however, if you attempt to collect that now you will not be able to turn back for the Leather Jacket.

## Other Nearby Items 
In the same room as the Leather Jacket, the [Stun Gun](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/stun-gun/) can be found next to the dead body hanging. Additionally, the [Rebreather](/sons-of-the-forest/guides/rebreather/) can be found by taking a left at the fork at the 4th light. 

## More Possible Locations
Currently, there is only 1 known location for the Leather Jacket. More locations may come in future updates, but at this time players can only obtain it at the location above.
We will make sure to update our map with any new spots when Sons of the Forest gets any new updates for the Leather Jacket.

## Obtain Once
The Leather Jacket can only be obtained once. If the item had other spawn locations (Which may happen in the future), they would despawn preventing you from picking up multiple versions of the item. This is how Sons of the Forest enables the players to have multiple options when looting major items. 

## Conclusion
You have to explore a cave for the Leather Jacket and there is only 1 known location to obtain it. So, if you want to collect all the items in Sons of the Forest, make sure you head to the marked spot and collect your Leather Jacket!
