The Cascual Survivors, Mala Zedik and Katala Swiftwind, officially welcome you to our website!
{{< /lead >}}

First and foremost, thank you for visiting our site and checking out the content we are offering.

The site will be operated by a pair of best friends that have been gaming for over 10 years. For more information about Mala Zedik and Katala Swiftwind, please check out our author pages for more information about us. 

We will slowly be adding content and games to our collection on this website. We will provide a roadmap sometime this year, 2023, to provide you with some insight into what we are doing and what you can see in the future of Casual Survivors. 

For now, though, we want to welcome you and thank you again for visiting our humble website. We hope to connect with you more soon! :)
