## Deadpoly Rebuild Demo
The first playable demo from the Deadpoly Demo is out now! If you own a copy of Deadpoly currently and would like to test out the demo, today is your lucky day! Head to your Steam library and right-click Deadpoly in your game library. Select the bottom option "Properties..." and a new steam window will appear. In this window, you want to select the "Betas" tab on the left-hand side to change views. On the Betas screen, there is a 'Beta Participation' option with a dropdown box. Click on the box for a section of options. You want to select the "rebuild - epic intensifies" option for the Demo. Once selected, Steam will start to download the Demo for Deadpoly.

## Download Warning
Before you download the Demo, it is strongly encouraged to back up your Deadpoly Legacy saves if you are planning to still play the Legacy version of Deadpoly. If you are not concerned about the Legacy Version, then you can ignore this warning!

Your saved files can be located in the %appdata%\Local\Deadpoly folder. 

## Demo Version
As a friendly reminder, this is a **DEMO** meaning this is not intended for you to play on it long term. It is intended to be a preview of things to come. Even the creator, Kamron, has stated; 
> "The demo is not optimized basically at all, and is basically unplayable on machines without a graphics card. Optimization will continue to happen throughout the development process."
