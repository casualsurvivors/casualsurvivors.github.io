Deadpoly continues to support us with bug-fixes at an amazing rate as patch 0.0.2g is now out! Let’s take a look at what was fixed in game.

Below is a list of changes that came with the patch:

– Networking adjustments

– Fixed implemented to actually delete the trash bag after you remove the items from it

– More adjustments for VOIP – not likely to fix map wide voip yet

– Fixed infinite pickup items in Bunker 11

– Total armor changed to per body part (heavy armor no longer reduces headshot damage!)

If you haven’t purchased the game yet… Well you should! It’s only on steam at this time. (As far as we are aware, it will not release on consoles.)

Casual Survivors will continue to bring you Deadpoly updates as we get them! Stay alive out there in this zombie apocalypse!
