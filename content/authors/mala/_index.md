## Welcome! 

Thank you for visiting my author page to learn more about me.

I've been creating content for video games since 2011. Starting with Terraria and Rift, I slowly expanded my selection of games from there.

I love to keep things simple and to the point. None of that over-the-top stuff that a lot of content creators do on YouTube. 

If you have any questions you'd like to ask me, please connect with me on the Casual Survivors [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZXp93XsKnN)

More in-depth information about me can be found on my Mala Zedik website.
